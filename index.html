                <p class="about-buddha">
                    The Buddha (also known as Siddhartha Gotama or SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni) was a philosopher, mendicant, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader.
                    The Buddha was born into an aristocratic  family in the Shakya clan but eventually renounced lay life.
                    His followers, known as Buddhists, propagated the religion that is known today as Buddhism. The title buddha was used by a number of religious groups in ancient India 
                    and had a range of meanings, but it came to be associated most strongly with the tradition of Buddhism and to mean an enlightened being, one who has awakened from the sleep of ignorance and achieved freedom from suffering.
